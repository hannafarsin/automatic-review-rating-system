# Automatic-Review-Rating-System

## Project Overview
This project implements a Review Rating System using Machine Learning that automatically predicts the rating (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) based on the textual content of user reviews. By training models on labeled review data, the system learns to associate language patterns with sentiment and score, enabling scalable and consistent rating predictions for platforms with large volumes of user feedback.
